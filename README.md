# Cabbage Bot
A bot which counts how many cabbages and minimuffins someone has received/used. A running joke within BxSci.

## Key Terms
- Cabbaged: Receiving a cabbage

## How to Play
- If you refer to someone at the end of your sentence, that person is susceptible to getting "cabbaged". Examples include:
    - i hate you, altanis
    - hi altanis
    - bro altanis
- To avoid getting "cabbaged", the target must start off their sentence with the word "minimuffin". They may send anything after minimuffin.
- If two people have targeted this person, only one minimuffin has to be used to nullify the cabbaging effect.
    - **BEWARE: PEOPLE WHO USE MINIMUFFINS CAN TRY CABBAGING SOMEONE IN THE SAME SENTENCE.**
- If you do not use minimuffin, or you do not use it correctly (not at the start of your first sentence after someone tries cabbaging you), the person can say "cabbage" and you will have been cabbaged.

### [HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED INTO BOT YET]

- If the person does not cabbage the target within 10 seconds, the player can say "turnip" and the cabbage cannot process.
- If the person does not cabbage you properly but still sends "cabbage", the target can cabbage them back by saying "cabbage improper usage".
- If someone says "i am <adjective>", adjective being anything like "tired", "hungry", etc, that can be a new temporary alias until 10 seconds have passed or you have already gotten cabbaged.


## Bot Usage
<p>To engage in the cabbage game, you must use the command `.register`. The arguments passed in will be your name.<br>
EXAMPLE: `.register altanis`<br>
You may register more than once to have different aliases.<br>

After that, people who have registered must play the game themselves. The bot will detect if that person has been cabbaged.<br>
The person's cabbaging attempt **must** end with an alias the bot knows (from  the `.register` command), or else it won't work.<p>

You can use the command `.leaderboard` to get a leaderboard, sorted from the people with the most amount of cabbages to the least amount of cabbages.
